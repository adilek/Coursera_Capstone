    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to find potentially useful regions for opening new coffee shops in Baku city.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a tradition, Azerbaijan people mostly drink tea, while westerners like coffee. So there are many tea houses called \"chaykhana\" where people go to drink tea and play board games (especially Dominos, Backgammon). However, the atmosphere of \"chaykhana\"s are noisy, and it is not suitable for study, work, reading. In contrary, coffee shops have a satisfactory atmosphere for such activities as reading. In recent years Baku people are looking for quiet places to study, to talk or to have some activities which are done better in quiet locations. Considering the concerns mentioned below, we can think that coffee shops seem to be a great business to do as there is a demand. Recently opened coffee shops are good examples to prove the feasibility of the idea.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, I conducted research using data science techniques and find optimal places for opening a coffee shop that might be interesting to stakeholders. An optimal location means they meet specific criteria which may make the coffee shop more profitable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** I used some methods from https://cocl.us/coursera_capstone_notebook [1] and https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/housing-sales-prices-venues-data-analysis-ofistanbul-sercan-y%C4%B1ld%C4%B1z/ [2]."

    "# Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, people in Baku meet near to \"city centre\" to have their business meetings. The city centre is the area which around \"Sahil\" subway station. The main reason I guess is ease of accessibility and presence of many ways to get in there using public transport. Hence, we choose that location as a central point. \n",
    "Additionally, other regions like:\n",
    "* \"Elmlar Akademiyasi\" station;\n",
    "* \"28 May\" station; \n",
    "* \"Khatai\" station\n",
    "are also good candidates for such activities because they are very close to the city centre.\n",
    "\n",
    "The existing coffee shops in those neighbourhoods have a good profit. The distance from \"Sahil\" to each of these places are not more than **3-4 kilometres**. Thus, I use a 4km radius to search for potentially profitable locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "I used Geocoding API [3] from Google Cloud (paid) and Foursquare API [4] for getting information about points of interests. Additional tools and resources are used to do various manipulations on the data to improve quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize:\n",
    "* The centre point are coordinates of \"Sahil\" subway station\n",
    "* The radius for discovery is 4 kilometres\n",
    "* Geocoding API from Google Cloud is used for converting addresses to coordinates and vice-versa.\n",
    "* I used Foursquare API for obtaining information about points of interest."

    "First, we need to define a central point and then generate candidate areas within a 4km radius around it. Let's find a central point for Baku. As we discussed in the previous section, we will consider \"Sahil\" subway station as a central point(city centre/downtown).\n",
    "\n",
    "The coordinates of \"Sahil\" subway station are **[40.3702583, 49.8462667]**. Let's mark the candidate area. The candidate area is a circular area within **4 kilometres** from the city centre. Moreover, I divided the area into **400 meters** small neighbourhoods to make a grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do so, I am creating a rectangular grid using two nested loops and checking if it lies inside a candidate area. I am using the equation of a circle to find if a point is inside a circle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another problem here is that the values for coordinates are in degrees. It is challenging to compute coordinates. Thus I convert them into a Cartesian coordinate system using World Geodetic System (WGS) [5] also known as WGS84 (latest revision). \n"

    "\n",
    "First of all, we need to find a way to remove those regions because we can not propose them as a candidate area. To do so, we need to obtain polygon of the sea. It is okay to use shapefile of Caspian Sea [6]. The reason why I do not want to use it is that it is too vast and too detailed. Thus it would be difficult and slow to compute if the dots are inside it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, I used Google Maps [7] to make a shapefile, which contains an area in our candidate regions, while smaller enough in size. Google Maps allows us to download it in KML [8] file format. Then I convert it into GeoJSON [9] format using **mygeodata.cloud** tool [10].\n",
